# Bastet's Labyrinth
A bullet-hell dungeon crawler whose elevator pitch is succinctly expressed thus:
> _"Good: a catgirl goddess wants to marry you! Bad: her parents want to make sure you're worthy of her first..."_

Made wtih Godot 3.6.

## Flow of play
1. The player has crazy dreams in which they're transported to ancient Egypt.
2. Bastet tells them she's been watching them from afar, has taken a 'lichen' to them, and would like to get to know them better, with the eventual goal of having them as an eternal consort.
3. They're shown on an awkward but happy cafe date
4. Bastet shows the player the Hub
5. In mid-tour, she gets a phone call from Osiris, they argue a bit
6. She says her family thinks she's nuts for wanting to go out with a mortal, says they want to meet you to make sure 'thou art worthy of me or whatever'.
7. In the Hub area - some kind of temple - the player encounters disapproving members of Bastet's family and is asked to do some kind of task to prove their worth.
8. Player is then taken to a dungeon, and must defeat a boss, pick up the thing the boss drops, then return to the Hub through a portal and give it to the family member who asked for it.
9. During play, some monsters drop golden coins when shot, these can be collected and traded for crossbow upgrades or more health in the Hub (at al-Kutbay's Souvenirs).
10. Whilst in dungeons, when the player first enters a new chamber, the doors lock behind them until the enemies populating the room have been killed, or, if it's a room with a chest or a healing spring, for 10 seconds, after which they unlock automatically.
11. Players can find or buy some kind of parchment that, when read, gives them a portal back to the hub without dying or losing progress (so they can buy powerups).  A corresponding portal opens in the hub that'll take them back to where they were.
12. The player can also find bottles of cola that grant temporary increased movement speed and invincibility.
13. After completing all the dungeons, the player is subjected to one final boss (TBD).
14. After defeating that boss, the player is informed that 'dad sayeth we could borrow the chariot!' and invited by Bastet to come do the sunrise together.
15. They kiss.
16. The player asks if this is a dream. Bastet coyly asks if it really matters, then says that yes, while it _is_ all just a dream, whenever 'thou and I art together, thou needst not worry about that anymore'.
17. During the end credits, there is art of the player going into the same cafe, and behind the counter, there's a new, suspiciously-familiar woman barista with cat ears and a familiar accent...

## Notes
- Freya thinks of Bastet as a little sister that has to be protected.  Bastet loves her, but is also mildly annoyed by always being told what to do by her.
- Bastet is really proud of herself for having learnt to read and write Coptic in university, and is mildly surprised that it's not more widespread in the modern human world.
- Bastet mentions that she once got in trouble for getting caught ditching middle school and smoking catnip.
- If Bastet weren't immortal, she'd be about 20 by appearance and maturity level.  The player is depicted as being about the same age.
